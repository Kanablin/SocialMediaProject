SocialMediaDatabase Functions:

- outputAccountInfo (good)
 - reads through accounts (arraylist) and puts it back into the accountInfo (String)

- readDMFileNames (good)
 - reads through DMFileName (string) and inputs all of it into DMs (arrayList)

- outputDMFileNames (good)
 - reads through DMs (arraylist) and inputs all of it into DMFileName (string)

- readDMs (fine)
  - different from readDMFileNames as readDMFileNames reads from existing info from 
    constructor (DMFileName in line 15) and inputs that into DMs (ArrayList
    readDMs reads from a given filename (String) and just simply returns that but
    in a arrayList
  - may not be definitely needed, but not a problem to have in the code

- outputDMs (good)
  - reads through messages (ArrayList of messages) and writes it out to filename

- getters (all good)

- addDM (almost completely good)
  - finds sender's username, reads through getter's friends and blocked
    makes sure sender can send message to getter
    makes the messageSize the index of messages
    adds the message to messages (arraylist)
    the getDMFiletxt gets a txt file that the message will be written on
    outputDMs output the arrayList of messages onto that filename from line 188
- don't fully understand functionaity of line 188, but probably fine just double check it

- removeDM (good)
  - checks for the specific index that the user wants to remove
  - find the username in that specific index of the messages arrayList
  - checks if it's in there, if so, removes it from messages
  - after, reindex the messages so if there were three message ([0], [1], [2]) and the
    middle one was taken out, it reindex [2] to [1]
  - creates a txt file of remover and the other account to write to
  - output the updated messages (arrayList) onto the txt file

- createDM (good)
 - creates a txt file of sender and getter to write to
 - checks if DMs (arraylist) already contains that txt file, if it does, it means those two accounts already dm'd each other
 - if not, it writes "[0] start DMs." to the txt file and returns that

- addAccount (good)
  - adds accountStats (String) to accountInfo (String)
  - then makes a Account object from the accountStats and adds that to the accounts (arraylist)

- login (good)
  - checks if username and password entered are equal
  - if so, returns that account that the username and password equal to
  - else, it throws exception

- findAccount (good)
  - goes through accounts (arrayList) and returns account with same name (not username)
  - if not, throws exception

- getDMFiletxt (good) IMPORTANT (was getDMFileName with two parameters, if test case don't work when it's getDMFileName with two parameters, change it to getDMFiletxt)
 - gets a filename based on the two accounts

- changeAccount (good)
  - changes the account based on given name and changes it to an account object
